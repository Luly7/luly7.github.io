## Projects
**Job Tracking Management System**

A Job Tracking Management System is used to manage various jobs or tasks within an organization.  I chose MongoDB because it is flexible for handling high volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and it offers real-time updates and scalability.  The system tracks the following entities:

1. Jobs: Represents a job or task that needs to be completed
2. Employees. People are assigned to work on the jobs
3. Job Statuses. Represents the status of a job (e.g. "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed")
4. Job Assignments: Tracks which employee is assigned to which jobs and the due date for completion

**Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning**

I used the KDD Cup 1999 Dataset, a popular dataset for IDS that contains network traffic data, which has been further preprocessed through feature selection, data normalization, and label encoding.
Then, three models were evaluated:

**Deep Learning for Retention Time Prediction in Reversed Phase Liquid Chromatography**

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately predicting
retention time (RT) for chemical compounds based on their SMILES representations. I explored the following deep learning models:
ChemBERTa + CNN, CNN, GNN, DistillRoBERTa-base.  The overall prediction performance showed that combining transformation-based global learning with CNN-based local feature extraction provides stronger predictive capabilities.

#Job Tracking Management System
A Job Tracking Management System is used to manage various jobs or tasks within an organization.  I chose MongoDB because it is flexible for handling high volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, and it offers real-time updates and scalability.  The system tracks the following entities:

1. Jobs: Represents a job or task that needs to be completed
2. Employees. People are assigned to work on the jobs
3. Job Statuses. Represents the status of a job (e.g. "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed"
4. Job Assignments: Tracks which employee is assigned to which jobs and the due date for completion
